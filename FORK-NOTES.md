The AUTHORS, COPYING and INSTALL documents I found in the tar ball
were without content. The authorship indicated in the source
of the applications is below

```
    * Unix 6
    * Editor
    * Original code by Ken Thompson
    *
    * QMC mods Feb. 76, by  George Coulouris
```

So this appears to be a derivitive work of Unix 6 (who holds this license I don't know) with specific authorship of Ken Thompson and George Coulouris. Bill Joy is mentioned in some of the related webpages where I found this code.  I am making this "FORK" because I want to be able to find this a few years from now and avoid the typical problems of web decay and historical rememberences.
